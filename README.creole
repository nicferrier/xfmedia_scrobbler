= xfmedia scrobbler =

The [[http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfmedia|xfmedia player]] is a 
nice simple client for playing media.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have a scrobbler. It does have a quite nice,
unixy, information system.

This is a daemon like program that reads the xfmedia information and
submits it to last.fm.

This is not ready for anyone else to use yet really... I am only just
getting it to work for me.
